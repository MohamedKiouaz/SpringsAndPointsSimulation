# SpringAndPointsSimulation
2D Simulation of points linked by springs using C++ and SDL.

## Examples
Look at screenshots to understand how it works.
On the example 1, you can see the user putting points.
All new points are linked to the selected point with a equilibrium length set to the current distance between the 2 points.
You can also move points or delete them.
When you press space, you set all the springs to a equilibrium length of 1.
Finally you can pause the simulation with P.
